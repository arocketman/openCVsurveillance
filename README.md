OpenCV-sorveglianza AKA motion triggered cam 

==================

Software developed with JAVA and OPENCV by Andrea Capuano & Mattia De Prisco. 

==================

Motion Triggered Cam will attach itself to your webcam and begin its loop:

Wait for movement
Record if there's any movement
Take lot of screenshots with time included
Put the images in a single .gif

the final result is a series of gifs , indicating the time, which will show the recording at the time the program registered a significant movement.
