==================

OpenCV-sorveglianza AKA motion triggered cam 

==================

Software developed with JAVA and OPENCV by Andrea Capuano & Mattia De Prisco. 

==================
The software was made for the "Multimedia system" exam. It's a simple surveillance system based on your webcam. The system will record movement and save it to a "gif" file.
Files won't be created if no movement is detected.

Motion Triggered Cam will attach itself to your webcam and begin its loop:

Wait for movement
Record if there's any movement
Capture the webcam image and save it to different ".jpeg" giles
Put the images in a single .gif

the final result is a series of gifs , indicating the time, which will show the recording at the time the program registered a significant movement.
